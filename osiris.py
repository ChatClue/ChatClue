def start_celery_worker():

    Starts a Celery worker as a subprocess.

    This method initiates a Celery worker using the subprocess module. The worker runs asynchronously 
    and executes tasks defined in the Celery application. The worker is configured to log at the 
    'info' level for better visibility of its operations.

    The function also ensures that the Celery worker is terminated gracefully when the Python script exits. 
    This is achieved using the `atexit` module, which registers a function to terminate the worker 
    as part of the script's cleanup process.

    Returns:
        subprocess.Popen: The subprocess object representing the Celery worker.
